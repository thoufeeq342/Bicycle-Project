## Overview

Customers are more likely to engage with promotions when they are clearly visible and easy to access. Magento 2 does not offer a native solution to display ongoing promotional rules on a single page. Customers have to discover discounts across various pages or rely on banners that may not always be up to date.

Offers Page extension for Magento 2 provides a centralized and automated way to showcase all current catalog and cart price rules on a dedicated frontend page. Store owners can decide which promotions to display by enabling a new option, Visible on Offer Page, while ensuring only active and valid rules are shown.

## Features

- Dedicated Offers Page to display promotions
- Display both Catalog and Cart Price Rules
- Only show promotions that are active and within a valid date range
- Add a "Visible on Offer Page" toggle in the rule edit form
- Backend configuration to enable or disable the module
- Fully responsive frontend layout
